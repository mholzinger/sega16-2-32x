# LOOP29 — the overnight ladder above opt1 (2026-09-09)

Continues LOOP28 (last entry 106). Protocol: `docs/handoff/LOOP-NIGHT-0909.md`.
Ledger: `docs/log/night-0909/LEDGER.md` (rig: `tools/night_run.py`; roms in
`rom/night/`, gitignored). Entries carry `date` output, the build line, md5,
the sliced speed table, and one-sentence conclusions. NEGATIVE RESULTS are
marked in their headings.

All speed numbers: `tools/gameplay_speed.py` semantics on the level-1
script, [1500,4100] total plus four 700-vint windows; 100% = 60 fps.

## 107. A1: THE ACCEPTED LINE REPRODUCES AT 49.7% (01:36-01:38)

    make clean; make ship-us FBXPORT=1       md5 1812b490   _end 0x60135d0
    build c2ef98f8 (HEAD after the rig commits), stamp R60

    total [1500,4100]   49.7%      IRQ4 misses 50.3% of vints
    1500-2200           49.7
    2200-2900           51.6
    2900-3600           50.0
    3600-4100           46.8
    anim mean           11.7  (windows 11.7 = T_singlebuf, LOOP28 93)
    black% f2000/3000/4000   4.4 / 4.4 / 4.4
    SPRLATE[3] ramp draws    1919 over 2600 vints   (the baseline for B)

Frame f2000 read: level-1 intro (Zeus, "I command you to rise"),
sprites and text intact. START-HERE's number and LOOP28 93's anim
figure both reproduce on today's source, so the rig and the tree agree
with the record. Rig cost: 148 s including the clean build.

Note: the rom that was in `rom/s16.32x` before this tick carried the
FBXSTAGE+FBXBOTH stamp (a double-buffer probe, 46.1%, black 17.9%);
it is in the ledger as `smoke_current` and is not a result.

## 108. A2: OPT1 READS 85.2%, THE LAST TWO WINDOWS ARE AT THE BAR (01:41-01:43)

    make clean; make ship-us FBXPORT=1 TXTWRAM=1 LATESTEAL0=1 LATEKEEP=1 DRAWADOPT=1
    md5 b436ea15   _end 0x60135d0   build 237fda56+

    total [1500,4100]   85.2%      IRQ4 misses 14.8% of vints
    1500-2200           58.6
    2200-2900           87.6
    2900-3600           98.9
    3600-4100          100.0
    anim mean           28.0
    black% / colours    3.7/6188  3.6/4632  3.6/3967
    SPRLATE[3]          1099   (base 1919)

Two expectations from the protocol did not hold, and neither is a
problem:

  - md5 b62237e5 cannot reproduce: `sh_src/buildstamp.h` bakes the git
    short hash into DIAG[18] (m_main.c:8541), so every commit changes
    the rom. The protocol's md5 expectation was wrong; the number is
    what reproduces.
  - 85.2 is not 82.3, and LOOP28 already read this line at 85.2/85.3
    (LOOP28 144, 159, 240) later in that session. The 3 points sit
    inside the 5.9-point floor of LOOP28 88.

The `diff vs base` column (1,317,320 bytes) is not the stale-bake test
here: base and opt1 differ in flags, so the asset region moves
legitimately. That test applies only between same-flag siblings.

**The finding.** The last two windows are 98.9 and 100.0: for 1400 of
the 2600 vints the game runs at the bar on this line. The whole
shortfall is the first window (58.6) and part of the second (87.6),
which is the intro and the first enemies. So the remaining cost is not
uniform; it is a heavy-regime cost. A3's timelines should sample the
heavy window (2000-2012 sits in it) and a light one (3000-3012, 98.9).

Frame f2000 read: level-1 with two purple enemies, HUD intact; the
intro caption has already scrolled off because the faster line is
further along at the same frame (the frame-indexed script, LOOP28 88).
