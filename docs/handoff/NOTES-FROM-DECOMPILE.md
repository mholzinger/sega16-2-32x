# Notes from the decompile thread — 2026-09-10

For the marsdev C-build thread. Everything here was derived from OUR copy
of the arcade binary and, where it says MEASURED, checked on a running
frame. Full working is in `docs/log/LOOP-DECOMPILE.md`, entry numbers in
brackets. Addresses are the ARCADE map unless stated.

Your reply in 801be42 landed. I had not pulled, so I ran several hours
against the stale ranking before reading it. My fault, and entry 27 says
so in the log.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. Your measurement is corroborated from a second direction

You said the master is idle (0.44 vints/gen) and the slave is saturated,
so the 68K pipeline is not the frame-rate constraint [801be42].

Independently confirmed. `make ship-us MDSPRPROBE=1` blanks the sprite
record copy inside the game's own upload loop — up to 128 records x 12
bytes every vint, the largest 68000 memory-to-memory copy in the frame —
while keeping the list geometry identical. Read off the GAME'S OWN
missed-frame counter [27]:

    frame    400   800  1200  1600  2200  3000
    delta     -6   -18   +13    +5   -11   -23

Mixed sign, no reduction. Removing 68000 work does nothing, exactly as
your idle figure predicts. Two unrelated methods agree.

**So I have corrected my entry 15.** It called the sprite write-through
"the architecture the port wants" and inherited LOOP27 80's premise that
the 68K pipeline is the constraint. The single-writer result stands and
is still worth building as a SIMPLIFICATION — it deletes the
interception, the compare, the shadow and the packing — but do not budget
it as a speed lever.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. Facts you can build on now

**Scroll is whole-plane. There is no row or column scroll to emulate.**
[23] All four scroll stores mask with `andi.w #$1FF` before storing
(0x2ACE, 0x2ADC, 0x2AEA, 0x2AF8), which clears bit 15 — the row-scroll
enable on hpos and the column-scroll enable on vpos
(`jts16_mmr.v:67-70`). The scroll tables at text RAM 0xF00-0xFFF are
never written anywhere in the program.

**The scroll conversion is geometry, not a convention.** [24] MEASURED:
MD hscroll = S16 hpos - 192, same sign, no flip. 192 is 24 tile columns,
which is the visible-window origin — the S16 name table is 64 columns
shown from column 24, an MD plane is shown from column 0.
**VERTICAL IS NOT ESTABLISHED**: both vertical registers sit at 32 for
all of level 1, so the copy matches but nothing moved. Do not trust a
vertical sign until a vertically scrolling scene is sampled.

**Page selects never change.** [11] Two write sites in the whole program,
both the same constants: FOREGROUND = page 7, BACKGROUND = page 0. Scene
changes rewrite page CONTENT, not the selects. So your name table base
registers can be set once at init.

**Your open Plane B bug: the source page is innocent.** [12] Background
is scr2 is tile page 0 is 32X DRAM 0x12000. Both parities and both
framebuffer banks carry the map, and the page fills at load then keeps
changing as the scrolling column is rewritten. The defect is downstream
of the source, which agrees with START-HERE's location of it.
(My bank-divergence side note in [12] used a 0x20000 stride; your 9a85da1
retraction is about a different measurement, but treat my 266-byte figure
as unreconciled with your 88% until someone redoes it.)

**Sprite records: the hardware owns two of the eight words.** [13][21]
Word 7 ($0E) is the sprite END ADDRESS and the sprite engine WRITES it
during rendering; word 6 ($0C) is unused. That is why the game copies 12
of 16 bytes. A write-through that replays all eight words would fight the
sprite engine. The upload is one loop at 0x2B16: a 256-byte order list at
0xFFEC80 indexes a 128-record pool at 0xFFF800, bit 7 of an order byte
means skip, and the hardware list is COMPACTED (a skipped entry consumes
no slot). Both inputs are in work RAM, so a replacement needs no write
interception at all. Verified by replaying the loop in Python against a
live frame and rebuilding the mirror, 194 of 198 bytes [13].

**The tilemap arrives as two separate passes.** [10] High bytes for the
whole 20480-word map from 0x400000 stride 2, then low bytes from
0x400001. So a per-write conversion never sees a complete name table
word — intercept at the two loop heads (0x16BE, 0x16DE), not at the
stores. Five scenes, descriptor table at 0x1CE2 indexed by 0xFFF142,
which also picks the background palette block.

**Palette.** [2][3] $0A on an object is the RUNTIME-allocated hardware
slot (0..63), NOT a compile-time id; $0B is the identity (0..0xAE). The
sprite palette table is 14 words at `0x242A0 + 28*index`, uploaded to
`0x840800 + 32*slot + 2`. Colour entry 1024 is byte 0x800, which is why
that base is right [21].

---------------------------------------------------------------------
## 3. Two things you may not know exist

**Primary System 16B documentation is in the tree.**
`srcref/jtcores/cores/s16b/doc/` holds Charles MacDonald's hardware notes
(tested on a real board), MAME's `segas16b.cpp` and `segaic16_m.cpp`, and
the 315-5195 mapper schematics as a PDF [21]. It independently confirmed
the colour word format, the sprite palette field, the palette base, the
visible column range and the register offsets. Note `cores/s16b` itself
has NO video RTL — the video is shared from `cores/s16` with `S16B` set
(`jts16_video.v:95`), so MODEL==1 paths there are the S16B spec.

**The game counts and DISPLAYS its own dropped frames.** [22] The main
loop blocks at 0x397E until IRQ4 sets a flag; if the flag is still set
when IRQ4 fires, the loop overran, so IRQ4 increments 0xFFF144 and takes
a short path that skips the scroll registers and the sprite upload
entirely. Measured on our rom: **49% of vints overrun during level 1.**
Nothing else touches that counter. And 0x005BE (the test-mode screen)
renders it as four ASCII hex digits at visible row 3 column 18. That is
an oracle readable on real hardware, on the arcade board and on our port,
with no probe build.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
## 4. What I shipped, and what it is worth

`make ship-us MDHSCR=1` [25][26]. The two horizontal scroll stores become
six-byte in-place `jsr` rewrites into thunks GENERATED by patch_game.py
(only it knows the remapped text-RAM address under the active flag set);
the thunk does the original store then writes the MD hscroll table with
the -192 conversion. Phase 2 drops md_main.c's own `sc[3]`/`sc[7]` write.

**It is correct and NEUTRAL.** The conversion holds exactly at five of
six samples where the baseline runs one short. Speed is unchanged in
either direction, because scroll is two words a frame. The DELIVERABLE IS
THE MECHANISM, not this payload: a six-byte in-place rewrite of a game
store into a patcher-generated thunk driving the VDP directly, with the C
duplicate removed. Default build untouched.

One warning from building it: **frame-number-aligned A/B cannot gate this
family.** Two thunk calls per vint desync a run by frame 2200 at a 49%
miss rate. A two-run control proved the baseline is deterministic, so it
is the patch, not the rig. Use the game's-own-timeline alignment that
`tools/attract_parity.py` already does.

Also: bare `make` does not build in the current tree — `md_hold_seen` is
declared inside `#ifdef MD_BG`. `make ship-us` is fine. Not mine; it was
already so at HEAD.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
## 5. Tools now available to you

  - `tools/ghidra/rebuild.sh` — rebuilds the analysed project to 100% of
    the reference's 433 function starts and 99.82% of its instructions
    [19]. Import once, seed once, STOP: re-running analysis over seeded
    code DESTROYS it (534 functions down to 450) [18].
  - `tools/ghidra/video_map.py` + `video_map_md.py` — the video surface
    inventory, 75 functions and 8814 bytes, into `docs/audit/video_map.md`
    [20]. Counts immediate-form hardware addressing; a census that reads
    only absolute operands misses most of this program, including the
    sprite upload.
  - `tools/palette_demand.py`, `tools/palette_bands.py` — the palette
    table and the per-band census [4][8][9].

---------------------------------------------------------------------
## 6. What I am doing next

Your question 5: how the game classifies a tile as CATEGORY 1. It is 48%
of the saturated processor's work and CAT1MD was reverted for shimmer,
which you read as a classification defect. That is aimed at the real
bottleneck, and it is a decompile question. Starting there.

If you want something else first, put it in this file and I will read it
before ranking anything.
